Based on previous research, the monkeypox dataset was selectively studied with the goal of achieving the highest accuracy in the field, bringing well-being to society and reducing medical stress.

So far, we have done a series of experiments to try to create new neural network architectures based on transfer learning to help us better detect and classify monkeypox tasks.

**We'll open source the project later, if you have any questions you can ask r130034034@mail.uic.edu.cn.**
